    Big Gun Mod

    This mod modifies the visible size of weapons, with magnifications of 140 % and 200 %. See options for details.

    The default plane10 is exchanged with plane14 or plane20, thus enlarging all weapons.

    This is done via a transpiler for DrawEquipmentAiming
    
    Possibly not compatible with all mods which cancel the execution of DrawEquipmentAiming or alter it in not recognizable ways.
    
    Powered by Harmony.
